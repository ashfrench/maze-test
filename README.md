This was an attempt to try and code in a more functional manner, making use of [javaslang collections](http://www.javaslang.io/) and [lombok annotations](https://projectlombok.org/features/) to reduce boilerplate code

If you are getting errors in your IDE, you made need to install the Lombok plugin. While the code compiles fine, the IDE may have issues with seeing the generated code.

The plugin for Intellij can be found [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin)
